Drug Design with AI Analytics

The first step in drug development is to understand the biological origin of a given disease and its resistance mechanisms. However, in the traditional process, it is very challenging to integrate a large amount of data sources — and then find the relevant patterns. Machine learning algorithms can do that easily and analyze thousands of sources just in seconds. And that happens already! MIT scientists have created a system that analyzes available science data and on that basis makes a compound. Researchers have tested the device and, with it, managed to make 15 medicines. Almost without human assistance! For example, they have managed to create a machine-made aspirin, and four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Another challenge the scientists are facing every time they develop a new medicine is clinical tests. In order to succeed you have to find suitable candidates – first animals and then humans. AI with its machine learning can considerably speed up the process of looking for these candidates and rejecting the wrong ones. AI analytics can analyze genetic information to identify the proper patients for the tests. AI/ML can also reduce data errors, such as duplicate entries. AI algorithms, therefore, can indicate the perfect candidates for the clinical tests. As a result, it reduces animal testing and human clinical trials in pharmacy, because more data can be gained without their participation.
